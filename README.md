# Olivier's Game of Shells

Hello and welcome to my Game of Shells implementation !

# Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS (tested with version > 16)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Chosen technologies

- [React !](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) (I love CSS in JS), I could have picked [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) too.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a new build tool for web projects.
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), to detect and fix linting issues.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), to automatically format on save my files.

# Get started

- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start a local instance of the app.
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` with the browser of your choice (tested with Chrome only :D) !

# More options

- `npm run lint` to check for linting issues.
- `npm run lint-fix` to fix automatically 'fixable' linting issues.

# Areas of improvements - If I had more time

## Look and feel improvements.

As you can see CSS is not my strong suit ! I see two possibilities to improve the look and feel of the app:

- Use SVG that I find on the internet / ask a designer to draw the shells, in a company I would definitely ask for a designer's shell :-).
- Spend some time to use a design system for the rest of the app. Something like [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) has caught my eye recently.

## More tests.

I would add more tests. Some E2E tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) could be added, too.

# Disclaimer

- I developed the app on Windows (on my personal computer). Apologies in advance if you encounter CRLF issues while checking out the app.
- I only tested the app on Chrome. I think it should be fine on Edge and Firefox though, I don't know about Safari!
